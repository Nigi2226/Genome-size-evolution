### Abstract (summary)
This study explores the enormous variation in eukaryotic genome size (from ~2 Mb in some fungi to >4,000 Mb in certain plants) and tests whether this variation is linked to taxonomic affiliation and ecological niche. Using a dataset of >500 eukaryotic species, the authors combine:

- Classical statistics (ANOVA + Tukey HSD)
- Unsupervised machine learning (K-means & hierarchical clustering)
- Supervised machine learning (Random Forest regression for genome size prediction)
- Agent-based evolutionary simulation of niche-driven selection on genome size

Key findings:
- Plants have significantly larger genomes than Fungi, Animals, and Protists
- Ecological niche and coding-sequence count (CDS) are strong predictors of genome size
- Random Forest models that include niche information greatly outperform models using only GC%
- Simulations show that terrestrial niches select for smaller genomes while aquatic/parasitic niches favor genome expansion

The work supports the hypothesis that genome size is an adaptive trait shaped by environmental pressures rather than a simple byproduct of organismal complexity (the classic “C-value enigma”).
